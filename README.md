How to install the files

Make sure that you have the WET 3.0 build folder in your root directory.
Copy the following directories into a folder created in the root.  In the SSI example available, this folder is called "SSI-demos". This demos folder should have the following folders:

 * inc\ 
 * theme-gcwu-fegc\ 

"inc" is a folder with your global include files that are unrelated to a specific theme.
Another &quot;inc&quot; folder for theme-specific includes is under the theme-gcwu-fegc folder, as well as a folder for main &quot;menu&quot; based includes. Final, the folder with your shtml pages is located here.

 * theme-gcwu-fegc\inc 
 * theme-gcwu-fegc\menu 
 * theme-gcwu-fegc\shtml
